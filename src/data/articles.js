						Worked on "Neon Express", developed as the final project for the Programming for Games, Web & Mobile program at Vancouver Film School. Worked implementing gameplay/parkour mechanics, UI design, UI implementation, & shader development.

						• Programmed in a team of six, with three additional audio and
						animation collaborators.
						• Implemented movement mechanics such as wall-running, sliding,
						and mantling, coded to work with physics interactions from
						high-speed trains.
						• Designed and implemented UI and shaders, iterating using
						feedback from team members, playtesters, and mentors.
